# Cozmo-Movement-Demo: Variation 2 assignment and other Movement scripts

Group Members: Matthew Dargan, Kayla Felderman, Kody Leuang, Danny Stutz, Forrest Musgrove

This is a demo for Cozmo movement, speech, and animations.  Read through the sample code for examples of how to get Cozmo to move forward, speak, turn, and perform an animation.  Once you understand the code, think about how to accomplish the various challenges.  In class on Thursday, you will break up into groups, and either fork this repository (and name your fork based on the variation you are working on) or create a new repository and include information on your challenge.  These variations are designed to demonstrate ways to control Cozmo's movement, and may be useful in projects.

1.	Speech, Movement and Animation
    a.	Sample Code:
        i.	Move forward
        ii.	Turn 90 degrees (left and right)
        iii.	Spin in a circle
        iv.	Perform a behavior
        
    b.	Challenges (students form 5 groups...when you write your programs, be sure to document what "one unit" is!):
    
        i.	Variation 1:
            1.  Cozmo is at (0,0) and moves to (x,y) moving vertically, then horizontally, and then performs an animation
            2.  Cozmo is at (a,b) and moves to (x,y) moving vertically, then horizontally, and then performs an animation
        ii. Variation 2:
            1.	Cozmo is at (0,0) and moves to (x,y) moving horizontally, then vertically, and then performs an animation
            2.	Cozmo is at (a,b) and moves to (x,y) moving horizontally, then vertically, and then performs an animation            
        iii.	Variation 3:
            1.	Cozmo is at (0,0) and moves to (x,y) alternating one unit vertically and then one unit horizontally until it can only move  vertically or horizontally, and then performs an animation
            2.	Cozmo is at (a,b) and moves to (x,y) alternating one unit vertically and then one unit horizontally until it can only move vertically or horizontally, and then performs an animation
            
        iv.	Variation 4:
            1.	Cozmo is at (0,0) and moves to (x,y) alternating one unit horizontally and then one unit vertically until it can only move vertically or horizontally, and then performs an animation
            2.	Cozmo is at (a,b) and moves to (x,y) alternating one unit horizontally and then one unit vertically until it can only move vertically or horizontally, and then performs an animation
            
        v.	Variation 5 (we will try to do the math, and recognize the problems with generalizing this ideaâ€¦):
            1.	Cozmo moves in a circle of radius r clockwise once, and then performs an animation
            2.	Cozmo moves in a circle of radius r clockwise k times, and then performs an animation
            3.	Cozmo moves in a circle of radius r counter-clockwise once, and then performs an animation
            4.	Cozmo moves in a circle of radius r counter-clockwise k times, and then performs a behavior
